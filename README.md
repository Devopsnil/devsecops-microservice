# DevSecOps Microservice Project

## Overview
This project is a sample microservice demonstrating DevSecOps practices, including code quality, security scanning, and automated deployment.

## Tools Used
- **GitHub**: Source code management and version control.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the microservice.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision cloud resources.
- **SonarQube**: Static code analysis for code quality and security issues.
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Scans project dependencies to detect known vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins** (optional): Automate CI/CD pipeline including builds, tests, and deployments.

## Key Features
- Automated scanning of code quality with SonarQube.
- Dependency vulnerability scanning using OWASP Dependency-Check.
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.
- Containerized microservice using Docker.
- Secure and automated CI/CD pipeline.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the Docker container.
3. Run Terraform to set up infrastructure.
4. Use SonarQube and OWASP Dependency-Check to scan your code and dependencies.
5. Push changes and let CI/CD pipeline automate testing and deployment.

## Important Notes
- Large files like Terraform providers are excluded from the repo and added to `.gitignore`.
- Use GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication when pushing code.
